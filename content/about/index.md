## KSCU History

KSCU 103.3 FM continues a long tradition of radio broadcasting at Santa Clara University dating back to 1948 when Fr. Ferdinand J. Spieler, S.J., created KVSC, “The Kampus Voice of Santa Clara.” Reflecting the mission and goals of Santa Clara University, the station has a proud history as a forum for the debate of issues, ideas, and concerns on-campus and in the surrounding community, and it offers an eclectic selection of non-commercial music, sports, and public affairs programming.

Currently, the station is staffed by seventeen students and features over 140 different DJs. To view our current show and DJ roster, check out our [schedule](/schedule/).
