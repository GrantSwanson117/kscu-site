Did you know that KSCU has had two NBA players on air in back to back seasons? In January of 2023, KSCU had the chance to interview Santa Clara Basketball star and Oklahoma City Thunder forward Jalen Willams. Well how about the players on the KSCU airwaves in back to back years? Our sports director Thomas Dunn had the chance to st down with the latest Broncos product, Golden State Warriors guard Brandin Podziemsksi. The Underground Sound already met the hardwood once and did so again, with a wonderful guest and great discussion about Podziemski's journey and career to date!
