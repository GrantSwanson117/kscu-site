## Andrew Bird - Are You Serious

### Review by Sally Walsh

Andrew Bird's 13th album, 'Are You Serious' centers around his smooth, deep, and harmonic voice over the sounds of gorgeous strings and a jazz-like backing of percussion.

_Capsized_ starts with a quiet, rock-like guitar line bringing you into the start of his album strongly. _Roma Fade_ is strong with the use of stings, bouncy and fast-paced, it has you imagining running through a city. Easily the best and strongest of the pieces on this album, it is filled with wonder and wanderlust. Bird talks of "rearranging your molecules" at the sight of "you". _Chemical Switches_ is slower and somber, a perfect lul in the middle of the album. _Are You Serious_, has sharp and plucky strings before swinging into a full band where you find yourself front row in a small and intimate venue. Often, the strings on this album, like many of his more-recent albums, has a western-twang, transporting the listener with Bird to the Americana canyon.

_The New Saint Jude_ is incredibly playful, with the vocal track sounding more live, strings tangle together beautifully throughout the three minutes. The instruments are bouncy and all incredibly present at the same time without fighting for the listeners attention. Like many of his songs throughout this and other albums, the roughed-up guitar lines bring together the whole sound perfectly between the lower and higher chords. This song perfectly balances the higher and lower toned and the lighter and darker messages throughout the lyrics.

_Valleys of the Young_, a nearly 6 minute song, takes the listener through ups and downs, with high-strung guitars, cymbals, and piano all in one at the crescendo near the end of the song.

Bird closes out the album with his song _Bellevue_, a swinging string laced ballad which summarizes all the hopeful closing feelings of another gorgeous album, we can only wait and see what else Andrew Bird puts out into this most wonderful world.

## C418 - Minecraft: Volume Alpha

### Review by Austin Douthit

As someone who grew up playing Minecraft and still occasionally plays to this day, I’ve always been a fan of C418's music, and more specifically this album, but have never listened to many of the songs outside of the game itself. I knew going in that a lot of the songs would have a kind of whimsical, explorative sound and I was very excited to see if I was correct and how the German artist approached making one of the greatest videogame soundtracks of all time.

The opening track “Key” introduces the listener to the light piano notes that appear consistently throughout the entire album as well as sets the tone for the kind of songs that will play throughout. Since there are so many songs on the album, I won’t be breaking each one down, but my favorites were “Door”, “Minecraft”, “Mice On Venus”, “Dry Hands”, and “Sweden”. 

“Mice On Venus” hits especially hard, and somehow fills me with an overwhelming sense of accomplishment and nostalgia every time I hear the song. After listening to the whole album, it was very clear that C418 somehow created an album that captured exactly how the game feels. Having played Minecraft, I know that every song from the soundtrack comes in at random, and somehow each time the soundtrack comes in, it meshes perfectly with whatever I may be doing in game. C418 consistently uses a similar 3 note motif throughout the record that gives each song a sense of familiarity, and contributes to what makes each song feel so nostalgic. 

Minecraft - Volume Alpha is easily one of my favorite albums that I’ve listened to and after finishing the record, I had an unrelenting urge to start up Minecraft once again: 10/10 album.
