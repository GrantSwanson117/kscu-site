## Where We Go - Animal Eyes

### Review by Cooper McCarthy

Where We Go by Animal Eyes is an interesting album that, while creative, didn't quite resonate with me. The instrumentals and beats in the tracks were intriguing and varied, but unfortunately, they overpowered the vocals of the singers. As a result, it was difficult to comprehend the lyrics or understand their meaning.

Despite this issue, I found the musical background of the album to be quite interesting. The band does a great job of creating diverse and engaging beats, giving each track a unique sound and feel. Each song offers something new and different, making for an enjoyable and creative listening experience. However, as mentioned before, the volume of the lyrics is a significant drawback. I found myself struggling to hear and understand the words, which left me feeling confused and disconnected from the music. Even when I could make out the lyrics, they were often forgettable and lacking in catchiness.

Overall, Where We Go by Animal Eyes is an album that I found interesting, but not particularly memorable. It might be suitable as background music, but I wouldn't actively seek it out to listen to again. While the band clearly has talent and creativity, they could benefit from focusing more on the lyrics to create a more well-rounded listening experience.

While the instrumentals and musical background of Where We Go are enjoyable, the lyrics are forgettable and difficult to comprehend. Animal Eyes have the potential for great success, but they would benefit from putting more emphasis on their lyrical content. With some improvements, this band could truly shine and create an impact.

I think that Animal eyes can see some really great improvements with the few issues that I have described and I'm excited to see where they will go in the music world.

## Sweet Trip - You Will Never Know Why

### Review by Ariana Tabrizi

I love quiet dream pop vibes in an album and this was exactly that. The mixture of quiet, melodic guitar chords in the background mixed with some cool electronic beats gave it a really nice almost other-worldly energy to it. I imagine myself sitting outside in the grass on a sunny day enjoying this album while drawing, reading, or just vibing.

The first two songs on the album, “Conservation of Two” and “Air Supply,” are some of my favorites. “Conservation of Two” starts with some really amazing vocals that overlap and are soft until the guitar comes in and the song sort of picks up. When I’m listening to this song, and all their songs for that matter, all I want to do is just close my eyes, run around, and bop my head around. “Air Supply” is sort of the opposite where it starts out with some guitar chords coming in and then switches to vocals with a techno scale in the background that just really hits and feels almost like it’s scratching an itch way in the back of your brain.

My third favorite song on the album is “Pretending” and, while I also love it for the sound, what really hits for me are the lyrics and the message of the song. It’s all about being present and in the moment, leaving the past to be memories that can be looked back on but that won’t take you away from building new memories and exploring new things in the present. I think this really goes with that general theme of the album that’s appreciating the small things like the little changes in the song and the bits of electronic beats added in that really transform the sound. And more than that I think the song amplifies those feelings of quiet contemplation and happiness that being in a chill environment brings to a person.

This album is all peace and appreciation for life, a great listen for anyone wanting some calming vibes to bop to throughout their day.

## Grouper - A I A: Alien Observer

### Review by Lauren Foster

A I A: Alien Observer is a beautiful experimental album that is so different from most things in the music world. Grouper has created something so haunting and ethereal and has made something that transports you to another realm.

The album starts with the track "Moon Is Sharp, " a blend of different sounds, voices, and melodies that sounds like the embodiment of space and the galaxy. This album contains a lot of deep emotions; some songs like "Come Softly-For Daniel D" are so beautifully sad and each song makes you feel like you're floating around in the sky.

One thing I enjoyed about Grouper's writing style is that she keeps her lyrics very simple. With that said, the simplicity doesn't take away from her ability to deliver beautiful and moving lyrics. One of my favorite lines is from the track "Vapor Trails" where Grouper sings "you never made a cloud float in the air. But you rise the atoms in the air with your smile" The album closes with the track "Come Softly- For Daniel D" which was something so simple but it was honestly amazing. The keyboard echoes through your ears as does Grouper's voice. This track was the perfect song to close out the album due to how delicate of a piece it is.

At times in this album, I did feel like there was a lot of repetitiveness. For instance “She Loves Me That Way” and “Mary, On the Wall- Second Heart Tone” feel very similar at times. However, I still think this was a well put together album.

Through this album, Grouper has demonstrated her ability to layer different tracks in an amazing way. While this album is short, only 39 minutes, it contains a great grouping of songs that left me wanting to hear more.
