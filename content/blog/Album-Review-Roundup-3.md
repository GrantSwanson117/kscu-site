Happy week 6 Broncos! Here are three album reviews and recommendations as you go into your second round of midterms, or start preparing for your finals. 

## Middle Sister - Isabelle Stillman

### Review by Carson Killer

Middle Sister, the debut album by Isabella Stillman, is an intriguing blend of various genres, showcasing the artist's versatility and range as a musician. While I personally didn't find myself completely drawn to the album, I must admit that the diversity of styles and sounds present on Middle Sister is impressive.

One of the standout tracks on the album is "Driving Alone" which features a bluesy guitar riff and soulful vocals. The track is raw and gritty, with lyrics that speak to the heartache of lost love. The following song, "Fine" is a complete departure from the previous track, with a pop-infused beat and catchy hooks that are sure to get stuck in your head.

As the album progresses, Stillman continues to mix things up. "Kid" has a folksy feel with acoustic guitar and harmonica, while "Worry" has a dreamy, electronic sound with airy vocals. The album closes with "Truth Is," amballad that showcases Stillman's emotive vocals.

Overall, Middle Sister is a solid debut from Isabella Stillman. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, the album's diversity of genres and styles is admirable. Stillman's ability to seamlessly transition from blues to pop to folk is a testament to her talent and creativity as a musician. I would recommend giving this album a listen, even if it's just to appreciate the breadth of Stillman's abilities.

## The Diet - Cullen Omori

### Review by Grace Roy

The Diet, Cullen Omori’s sophomore album,  is a contemporary approach to 70s rock and provides the listeners with a psychedelic and love-filled piece that is an easy and extremely satisfying listen.

The use of reverb and weepy guitar licks are deeply nostalgic, despite the record being released in 2018. Its lyrics are full of hope and adoration in its purest form, telling the of loving someone beyond their imperfections and accepting them for who they are.

Happiness Reigns is one of the most beautiful encapsulations of the thrill and true happiness that comes with unconditionally loving someone. the dreamy guitar to uplifting drum rhythm and hopeful and accepting lyrics like “The tears in your eyes/Your fingerprints and common sense/Have probably saved my life/Oh baby, please don't cry”. The reason this song is so intriguing is because it doesn’t exactly align with the traditional idea in rock of putting your love interest on a pedestal. The love described in this song is real, authentic and loving someone for who they are and how they love you.


Another track that I particularly adore is Four Years, the first track on this beautiful album. Like Happiness Reigns, this song is not a romanticized version of loving someone, but a description of the way love feels through beautiful chords and truthful lyrics like “you do so many things/ And I love you for it/but I usually forget”. It’s upfront honesty yet beautiful composition are an accurate representation of how it feels to love someone yet not be able to properly articulate your feelings, something Omori captures so well.


This album is not larger than life, grand, or triumphantly, but it is humble and and mystifying.

## Yggdrasil - A Year from Monday

### Review by Jackson Potter

Yggdrasil is a sonic journey that transports the listener to a world of their own making. The album's title is inspired by Norse mythology, specifically the world tree, Yggdrasil, which connects the nine worlds. It's a fitting title for an album that feels like a journey through different realms and landscapes. From the opening track, "The Root," it's clear that A Year from Monday has crafted something special. The track's moody intro gives way to a mesmerizing guitar riff that builds to a stunning crescendo, setting the stage for the rest of the album.

Yggdrasil is an album that rewards repeat listens. Each track is layered and complex, revealing new details with each listen. The band's ability to blend different genres and styles seamlessly is on full display throughout the album. "The World Tree," for example, is a hauntingly beautiful track that showcases the band's talent for creating ethereal soundscapes. The track's slow, atmospheric intro gives way to a driving beat that propels the song forward. Sheldon's guitar work is particularly impressive here, as he weaves in and out of the mix, creating an otherworldly atmosphere.

Another standout track is "The Bifrost," named after the rainbow bridge that connects Asgard and Midgard in Norse mythology. The track's opening riff is instantly recognizable, and it's easy to get lost in its hypnotic melody. The track's climax is particularly impressive, as the band builds to a cacophonous crescendo before bringing it back down to earth.

One of the things that sets A Year from Monday apart from other post-rock bands is their ability to create emotional connections with their music. Despite the lack of lyrics, each track feels like a journey with its own narrative. "Idunn's Orchard," for example, is a lush, dreamy track that evokes images of a mystical garden. The track's soaring melodies and shimmering guitars create a sense of wonder and awe, like discovering something magical for the first time.

In terms of production, Yggdrasil is a masterclass in post-rock soundscapes. The album was recorded live in a single room with minimal overdubs, giving it a raw, organic feel. The mix is clean and spacious, allowing each instrument to shine through. The band's use of effects and textures is also impressive, creating a sense of depth and space that's essential to the post-rock genre.
