## Middle Sister - Isabella Stillman

### Review by Carson Killer

Middle Sister, the debut album by Isabella Stillman, is an intriguing blend of various genres, showcasing the artist's versatility and range as a musician. While I personally didn't find myself completely drawn to the album, I must admit that the diversity of styles and sounds present on Middle Sister is impressive.

One of the standout tracks on the album is "Driving Alone" which features a bluesy guitar riff and soulful vocals. The track is raw and gritty, with lyrics that speak to the heartache of lost love. The following song, "Fine" is a complete departure from the previous track, with a pop-infused beat and catchy hooks that are sure to get stuck in your head.

As the album progresses, Stillman continues to mix things up. "Kid" has a folksy feel with acoustic guitar and harmonica, while "Worry" has a dreamy, electronic sound with airy vocals. The album closes with "Truth Is," amballad that showcases Stillman's emotive vocals.

Overall, Middle Sister is a solid debut from Isabella Stillman. While it may not be everyone's cup of tea, the album's diversity of genres and styles is admirable. Stillman's ability to seamlessly transition from blues to pop to folk is a testament to her talent and creativity as a musician. I would recommend giving this album a listen, even if it's just to appreciate the breadth of Stillman's abilities.

## Sweet Trip - You Will Never Know Why

### Review by Ariana Tabrizi

I love quiet dream pop vibes in an album and this was exactly that. The mixture of quiet, melodic guitar chords in the background mixed with some cool electronic beats gave it a really nice almost other-worldly energy to it. I imagine myself sitting outside in the grass on a sunny day enjoying this album while drawing, reading, or just vibing.

The first two songs on the album, “Conservation of Two” and “Air Supply,” are some of my favorites. “Conservation of Two” starts with some really amazing vocals that overlap and are soft until the guitar comes in and the song sort of picks up. When I’m listening to this song, and all their songs for that matter, all I want to do is just close my eyes, run around, and bop my head around. “Air Supply” is sort of the opposite where it starts out with some guitar chords coming in and then switches to vocals with a techno scale in the background that just really hits and feels almost like it’s scratching an itch way in the back of your brain.

My third favorite song on the album is “Pretending” and, while I also love it for the sound, what really hits for me are the lyrics and the message of the song. It’s all about being present and in the moment, leaving the past to be memories that can be looked back on but that won’t take you away from building new memories and exploring new things in the present. I think this really goes with that general theme of the album that’s appreciating the small things like the little changes in the song and the bits of electronic beats added in that really transform the sound. And more than that I think the song amplifies those feelings of quiet contemplation and happiness that being in a chill environment brings to a person.

This album is all peace and appreciation for life, a great listen for anyone wanting some calming vibes to bop to throughout their day.

## Grouper - A I A: Alien Observer

### Review by Lauren Foster

A I A: Alien Observer is a beautiful experimental album that is so different from most things in the music world. Grouper has created something so haunting and ethereal and has made something that transports you to another realm.

The album starts with the track "Moon Is Sharp, " a blend of different sounds, voices, and melodies that sounds like the embodiment of space and the galaxy. This album contains a lot of deep emotions; some songs like "Come Softly-For Daniel D" are so beautifully sad and each song makes you feel like you're floating around in the sky.

One thing I enjoyed about Grouper's writing style is that she keeps her lyrics very simple. With that said, the simplicity doesn't take away from her ability to deliver beautiful and moving lyrics. One of my favorite lines is from the track "Vapor Trails" where Grouper sings "you never made a cloud float in the air. But you rise the atoms in the air with your smile" The album closes with the track "Come Softly- For Daniel D" which was something so simple but it was honestly amazing. The keyboard echoes through your ears as does Grouper's voice. This track was the perfect song to close out the album due to how delicate of a piece it is.

At times in this album, I did feel like there was a lot of repetitiveness. For instance “She Loves Me That Way” and “Mary, On the Wall- Second Heart Tone” feel very similar at times. However, I still think this was a well put together album.

Through this album, Grouper has demonstrated her ability to layer different tracks in an amazing way. While this album is short, only 39 minutes, it contains a great grouping of songs that left me wanting to hear more.
