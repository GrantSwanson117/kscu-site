     At the start of the quarter, the KSCU office welcomed jazz musicians to jam together in front of an audience. The room was filled to capacity, with students packed closely together, swaying harmoniously to the wonderful music. While the talent on display was exceptional, the atmosphere was made even more enchanting when sixteen-year-old Jackson Takizawa took the front stage with his bass guitar. He instantly captivated the audience with riffs that the music gods themselves must have written. People lost their minds, drawn to the sounds emanating fro, Jackson's bass, while the other musicians sprang to life, each contributing to the bouquet of jazz. \
    Despite only having played the bass for four years, Takizawa is remarkably gifted. To support his musical aspirations, he recently joined a school program that provides him the time and flexibility that a budding musician needs. You can see him opening for Ryan Trujillo at The Breakroom on February 22nd. Until then, you'll have to imagine the soulful buzz of Jackson's amp.
