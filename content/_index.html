    KSCU 103.3 FM IS THE STUDENT-RUN RADIO STATION AT SANTA CLARA UNIVERSITY IN
    SILICON VALLEY.
  </h1>
  <p>
    KSCU 103.3 FM continues a long tradition of radio broadcasting at Santa
    Clara University dating back to 1948 when Fr. Ferdinand J. Spieler, S.J.,
    created KVSC, “The Kampus Voice of Santa Clara.” Reflecting the mission and
    goals of Santa Clara University, the Jesuit University of Silicon Valley,
    the station has a proud history as a forum for the debate of issues, ideas,
    and concerns on campus and in the surrounding community, and it offers an
    eclectic selection of non-commercial music, sports, and public affairs
    programming.
