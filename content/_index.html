      KSCU 103.3 FM continues a long tradition of radio broadcasting at Santa
      Clara University dating back to 1948 when Fr. Ferdinand J. Spieler, S.J.,
      created KVSC, “The Kampus Voice of Santa Clara.” Reflecting the mission
      and goals of Santa Clara University, the Jesuit University of Silicon
      Valley, the station has a proud history as a forum for the debate of
      issues, ideas, and concerns on campus and in the surrounding community,
      and it offers an eclectic selection of non-commercial music, sports, and
      public affairs programming.
